npm install
```

### Environment Setup
The application works out of the box with default configurations. For production deployment, configure your Supabase project settings as needed.

### Development Commands

#### Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
This starts the development server at http://localhost:5173

#### Start Storybook
```bash
npm run storybook
```
This launches Storybook at http://localhost:6006 for component development and documentation

#### Type Checking
```bash
npm run type-check
```

### Testing Commands

#### Unit Tests
```bash
npm run test          # Run tests
npm run test:ui       # Run tests with UI
npm run test:coverage # Generate coverage report
```

#### End-to-End Tests
```bash
npm run test:e2e      # Run E2E tests with Playwright
```

#### Accessibility Tests
```bash
npm run test:a11y     # Run accessibility compliance tests
```

### Production Commands

#### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

#### Preview Production Build
```bash
npm run preview
```

#### Performance Analysis
```bash
npm run analyze       # Analyze bundle size
npm run perf         # Run Lighthouse audit
```

### Code Quality Commands

#### Linting and Formatting
```bash
npm run lint         # Lint code with ESLint
npm run format       # Format code with Prettier
npm run format:check # Check code formatting
```

## Storybook Usage

Storybook provides an isolated environment for developing and testing UI components.

### Accessing Storybook
1. Run `npm run storybook` to start the development server
2. Open http://localhost:6006 in your browser
3. Browse components in the sidebar navigation

### Component Documentation
- Each component includes interactive controls for testing different props
- Documentation includes usage guidelines and accessibility information
- Use the viewport addon to test responsive designs
- Check accessibility compliance with the built-in a11y addon

### Building Storybook
```bash
npm run build-storybook
```
This creates a static build in the `storybook-static` directory for deployment.
