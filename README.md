## 📖 Documentation

### Storybook Documentation
Our comprehensive component library is documented in Storybook:
- **Development**: `npm run storybook` (http://localhost:6006)
- **Production**: Available at your deployed Storybook URL

### Component Guidelines
- All components follow the compound component pattern where applicable
- Consistent prop naming and TypeScript interfaces
- Comprehensive accessibility support with ARIA attributes
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

### Design System
- **Colors**: Semantic color tokens with dark/light theme support
- **Typography**: Consistent scale using Inter font family
- **Spacing**: 4px base unit with consistent spacing scale
- **Components**: 50+ reusable components with variants and states

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Component logic and utilities
- **Integration Tests**: Component interactions and data flow
- **E2E Tests**: Critical user journeys and flows
- **Accessibility Tests**: WCAG compliance and screen reader support
- **Visual Regression**: Component appearance consistency

### Test Organization
```
src/
├── __tests__/          # Test utilities and global test setup
├── components/
│   └── **/*.test.tsx   # Component unit tests
├── utils/
│   └── **/*.test.ts    # Utility function tests
└── e2e/
    └── **/*.spec.ts    # E2E test specifications
```

## 🎨 Component Architecture

### Design Patterns
- **Compound Components**: Complex components broken into logical sub-components
- **Render Props**: Flexible component composition patterns
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable stateful logic extraction
- **Context Patterns**: Efficient state sharing without prop drilling

### File Structure
```
src/components/
├── ui/              # Base UI components (buttons, inputs, etc.)
├── layout/          # Layout components (header, sidebar, etc.)
├── features/        # Feature-specific components
└── charts/          # Data visualization components
```

## 📊 Performance Monitoring
