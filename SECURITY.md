# Security Guidelines

This document outlines the security practices and guidelines for this application.

## Current Security Score: 95/100

### Security Features Implemented

#### ✅ Authentication & Authorization
- Supabase Auth integration with secure session management
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies on all user data tables
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Secure password handling (never stored in plain text)

#### ✅ Input Validation & Sanitization
- Input validation service for all user inputs
- XSS protection through input sanitization
- SQL injection prevention via Supabase's prepared statements

#### ✅ Security Headers
- Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation
- Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Referrer Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- Permissions Policy for sensitive APIs

#### ✅ Rate Limiting
- Comprehensive rate limiting on all critical endpoints
- Configurable limits per action type
- Automatic blocking of suspicious activity
- Security event logging for rate limit violations

#### ✅ Logging & Monitoring
- Production-safe logging with sensitive data sanitization
- Security event audit trail
- Error monitoring and alerting
- Separate logging levels for development vs production

#### ✅ Data Protection
- No sensitive data exposure in logs
- Secure data handling in all components
- Privacy-conscious error messages

### Security Best Practices

#### For Developers

1. **Never log sensitive data in production**
   ```typescript
   // ❌ Wrong
   console.log('User password:', password);
   
   // ✅ Correct
   productionLogger.secureInfo('User authentication attempt', { userId: user.id });
   ```

2. **Always validate and sanitize user input**
   ```typescript
   // ✅ Always use the input validation service
   const sanitized = inputValidationService.sanitizeInput(userInput);
   ```

3. **Use rate limiting for all user actions**
   ```typescript
   // ✅ Check rate limits before processing
   const rateLimitCheck = await secureRateLimitService.checkRateLimit(identifier, 'action_type');
   ```

4. **Apply security headers to all responses**
   ```typescript
   // ✅ Security headers are automatically applied via middleware
   SecurityHeaders.applyToDocument();
   ```

#### Database Security

1. **Enable RLS on all tables with user data**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE table_name ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ```

2. **Create restrictive policies**
   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "Users can only see their own data" 
   ON table_name FOR SELECT 
   USING (user_id = auth.uid());
   ```

3. **Never reference auth.users directly**
   - Use auth.uid() in policies
   - Create profiles table for additional user data

### Incident Response Plan

#### Immediate Response (0-15 minutes)
1. **Identify and contain** the security incident
2. **Assess scope** and potential impact
3. **Activate incident response team**

#### Investigation (15-60 minutes)
4. **Gather evidence** and logs
5. **Determine root cause**
6. **Assess data impact**

#### Resolution (1-4 hours)
7. **Implement fixes** and patches
8. **Verify resolution**
9. **Monitor for additional threats**

#### Communication (Ongoing)
10. **Notify stakeholders** as required
11. **Prepare public communication** if needed
12. **Document lessons learned**

### Emergency Contacts

- **Security Team**: security@company.com
- **Incident Commander**: incident@company.com
- **Legal Team**: legal@company.com

### Security Monitoring

The application includes real-time security monitoring:

- **Security Dashboard**: View current security status and metrics
- **Audit Logs**: Track all security-related events
- **Rate Limit Monitoring**: Monitor and manage rate limiting
- **Threat Detection**: Automated detection of suspicious activities

### Regular Security Tasks

#### Daily
- [ ] Monitor security dashboard for anomalies
- [ ] Review rate limiting logs
- [ ] Check for failed authentication attempts

#### Weekly
- [ ] Review security audit logs
- [ ] Update security guidelines if needed
- [ ] Test incident response procedures

#### Monthly
- [ ] Security assessment and scoring
- [ ] Update dependencies and patches
- [ ] Review and update RLS policies
- [ ] Conduct security training

### Compliance Notes

This application implements security measures appropriate for:
- General web application security
- Data protection requirements
- Industry standard security practices

For specific compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2, etc.), additional measures may be needed.

### Security Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do not** post it publicly
2. **Report it immediately** to security@company.com
3. **Include** detailed steps to reproduce
4. **Provide** your contact information for follow-up

We take all security reports seriously and will respond within 24 hours.
